## Physical
Here is you can join and organize meeting with people around you. Build together a local community.

### Meetups

#### Participate
Start by finding the closest Meetup next to you on Meetup.com.

#### Help organize
If you found a Meetup group but there is no upcoming Meetup, contact the organizer through the Slack channel and ask to help set up one.  (we should add a way to track Meetups, how active they are and how many people are in there).
If you haven’t found a close Meetup next to you, you can create one and become a Meetup organizer!  It can be in your workplace, neighborhood or city.  Join the #meetup organizers Slack channel and we’ll help you with everything you need - content, swag, sponsors and more!

#### Content
First check out the main messages we want to spread around the community (link to messages.md in the community repo).
Here is [the list](https://github.com/AngularCommunity/content) of prepared slide decks and videos of talks you can reuse at your Meetup.
Help add more content and improve the existing ones.

#### Conferences
Here is a Github repository with upcoming conferences. 
You can join as participant and connect with community members is the #conference-X Slack channel, 
you can also try to speak at those conference to grow our community and progress yourself. 
Join the #events channel to track open CFP requests and check out the list of existing talks to make it easier for you to prepare a talk. 
(Maybe we can use http://lanyrd.com/ with some curation)

#### Association
Drupal Association - Matt Davis first suggested this as an example of a community built organization whose goal is supporting and growing that community. There are several things that are unique about their work:
As a 501c3, the DA can hire staff and raise funds while being tax deductible.
Their main source of funds is revenue from the annual DrupalCon’s, but also companies and individuals can pay dues to the DA to support the project and receive membership badges on their public profile pages at drupal.org.
They select and run specific initiatives related to improving the project, often through the Community Cultivation Grants.
