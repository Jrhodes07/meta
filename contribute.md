# Lead, contribute and take action

The best way to learn is to teach and help others.

There is no need to be an expert in order to start helping, anyone can and should just try 
doing it in anyway you feel comfortable.
You can progress slowly as a contributer and you can ask help on how to progress as a contributer.

Here is your path to become a leader in our community.  You can contribute in many ways and all ways are meaningful and welcome. Start small and grow your skills gradually. 

### Your contributor profile
Your contributions will be track in your community profile and we will support you and promote you as much as we can as you move up and gather more badges and points on your community profile. Contributing to the community helps everyone but mostly yourself. It’s not only feels good, but also makes you a better developer and helps promote yourself in the community and job space.

Your profile will reflect the Meetups you are part of, the meetups you help organize, talk and conferences you participated in, your contributions to the docs, your contributions on Stack Overflow on the `x` tag, the issues you help triage and reproduce, the PRs you submitted to the library and the libraries you are a member of.

(Should this be a separate profile on the community site or maybe we can integrate it into the existing Github profile using badges, organizations and teams)
We will mention your contributions to any of those fields on our release notes.

Here is your path for leading and contributing in the community (and you can also contribute by improving the path itself):

# [Community](https://github.com/AngularCommunity/meta/blob/master/community.md)    -    [Docs](#docs)    -    [Support & Issues](#support-and-issues)    -    [Code](#code)


(add link here to the main Github project that gathers all tasks)

### Docs
The official docs are not the only resource and won’t cover everything.
For the topics that the official docs won’t cover there are few solutions.

The first place you should search for questions and resources is Google Search.
But Google Search not always gives you the best result.
This is why one of the most important contributions is once you found the answer for the question you asked, go back to Google, search for the question again, and direct and comment in all the top results into the right answer.  That will make the next hundreds after you find the answer quicker and will safe hours of development for everyone.

#### Stack Overflow
Usually the first resource that pops up in Google is Stack Overflow. Once you found the right answer, make sure to mark that answer as correct and also comment with additional information that can help the next developer after you.

#### Community docs
We have a website with subjects that are not covered in the official docs. 
Search for what you need there and add needed resources on things you can’t find.
That will also help the core team to review the needed content from the community and migrate some of it to the official docs.

#### Trainings, courses and tutorials
The best way to learn is to teach.
Here is a list of trainings and courses both online and offline.
You can submit your course or use one of the existing online resource to teach a friend. That would really help making you a better developer.

### Support and issues
The next step in helping the community is helping with answering questions and solving issues.
This can make you a better developer and also save a lot of time for the core team. Currently most of the time of the core team is spent on this instead of developing the next features we need.

#### Stack Overflow
Stack overflow is the first place people are getting into when searching for help.
You can help make sure they will find the right answer.
Keep track of the `x` tag on stack overflow.  You can start by going through the existing questions and join the #Technical questions & stack overflow feed to help keep track on current issues people face and help solve them in real time.
Once you solved a problem, try out a few Google searches that people might do when searching for that solution.  Then go through the results and make sure they all point to the right answer and place.

#### Github issues
One of the most important contributions is “issue triaging”. That means going through existing open issues on our Github repositories, ordering them and make sure they have all the information we need in order to solve them.
You can start by reviewing the issues and making sure they are ready according to the following process (link here to ISSUE_TEMPLATE on Github). Each step you add will make a big contribution, even if you were unable to do it all:

1. Mark the issue in the right category (Feature request, bug, etc..  link to list of badges)
2. Intendent outcome - what was suppose to happen
3. Actual outcome - What did happen
4. Reproduction (this is the most important part)
    A new repository with the simplest app possible that demonstrates 
    A video of your screen running that app and demonstrating the error
    
To track new issues, follow the **#github** Slack channel.
Getting an issue into this state is a huge contribution!  And makes it easy to move on to the next step.


### Code 
Here we will talk about contributions in code.  This is not the only or most important contribution, every step of the way is important and a great help.
Contributing to code is a process, you can think of it as a ladder you progress to. (we should create an equivalent of the Drupal Ladders)

#### Roadmap
Here is the roadmap of the core team (link to ROADMAP.md and to Github project tool). 
This way you know what we are aiming for, so you can contribute to that effort and spend time on efforts the core team won’t handle for now.
On the roadmap document itself you can help us in the following ways:

* Help us measure the status and success of each goals
* Offer different goals (in the #goals-and-roadmap Slack channel)
* Community goal - have 1% of our community being core contributors (moving up the ladder) 

#### Apps showcase
It is important to show example applications, both for helping people to see the possibilities and for promoting our Framework.
Here is a repository with links to example applications (link to a new “awesome-example-apps” repository).
You can submit issues for app types that are missing in there that will help you promote our Framework, improve the existing sample applications or submit a new one.

#### 3rd party libraries
Here is a repository with 3rd party library (link to a new “awesome” repository).
You can open issues for missing tools that don’t exist yet, submit existing libraries that are missing from the repository, go and help existing libraries or create new libraries that are missing and needed. 
Here are guidelines for creating a 3rd party library.

#### Help test beta releases
You can help us test new releases before they come out.
This will help us validate our releases and also will help you be prepared in advance for upcoming changes.
Join the #beta-testers Slack channel for more details.

#### Architectural overview
In order to help the community to contribute, we should have a high level architectural overview of the code. You can create one with any tool you want.
Pull requests for fixing issues (link to PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
Fixing an issue by submitting a fix to the library is a big deal!
The smaller the change, the better. That will help you contribute in a more gradual way and also will help the core team to review a smaller change and will increase the likelihood of your change to be merged.
When approaching an issue in order to solve it, start with just debugging it and sharing your debug results on the issue. Submit a video of your debugging session, even if you haven’t found the problem.
After that, create a design for the solution you are thinking about and submit that to the issue.
Only after, get into submitting a change. Make it as small as possible, if you can break it down into several changes do it and add tests to any change you make.
Please also understand and be patience after submitting the PR.  we can thank you enough for that be understand that sometimes it takes long time to review a change and it doesn’t mean we are not appreciating your contribution.

#### New features to core
Even the core team is not submitting new features without a design doc.
So start with creating a design doc (link to examples), share it in the #RFCs Slack channel and get feedback from fellow contributors and the core team.
