# Learn Angular

The docs are the first place you should go to when learning our framework.

### Resources
* Angular.io
  * Getting started
  * First tutorial
  * Guides and cookbooks
* Angular Community content repository

### Help and improve
But while you are reading any docs, write down how your experience went. 
We want to hear all about it.  Just having community members read deeply all of the docs is a huge help for that community and yourself.
We would love for you to submit issues describing your experience going through the docs, even if just general feelings.

You can submit fixes and changes to the docs in a PR. This is a very important contribution! The best help for the docs are from the ones who read it for the first time and know exactly how it feels.
